# Text_Completion
Description:-  Model demonstrates the fine-tuning of the GPT-2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It includes data preparation, tokenization, dataset creation, model configuration, and fine-tuning using the Trainer API.
The script fine-tunes GPT-2 on a custom text dataset, adapting it for specific downstream tasks like text generation, completion, or domain-specific modeling.Data set taken was of Product Review dataset

Features:-
Utilizes a pandas DataFrame column (df['Text']) as the input text data.
Converts text into tokenized sequences suitable for GPT-2. Used datasets library from huggingface to make it sutaible for GPT-2 model. Employs GPT-2 tokenizer (GPT2Tokenizer) with padding and truncation to standardize input length.


Model Configuration:

Loads the pre-trained GPT-2 model (GPT2LMHeadModel) for fine-tuning.
Supports tasks requiring the generation or completion of text sequences.

Model Architecture:
GPT-2 Overview
GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is a Transformer-based language model designed for natural language processing tasks. Key aspects of the GPT-2 architecture include:

Transformer Encoder-Decoder Architecture:

Self-Attention Mechanism: Computes relationships between all tokens in the input sequence.
Feed-Forward Layers: Processes representations after attention.
Embedding Layer:
Converts input tokens into dense vector representations.
Positional embeddings added to incorporate sequence order.

Fine-Tuning Adjustments:
Adds task-specific tokenized inputs and masks.
Trains pre-trained weights using supervised learning to adapt to the custom dataset.
